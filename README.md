## About

This repository contains my journey and projects while learning Python. It includes exercises, small projects, and notes on various Python topics.

## Documentation

### On day 1
    I made simple projects to get me started.
    I learned about how python reads from keyboard and how to make a function, then reuse it in another file.
### On day 2
    I was lazy and did not accomplish much. However i did learn how to package files and reuse them.
### on day 3
    I started testing with JSON files. Made my first JSON writer and soon after started working on a schedule program for my mom<3.
    I read about the best practice for this and considered using an API from [OpenHolidays](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/en/ "Go to Open Holidays API Page"). Ended up just using the [holidays-lib](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/ "Go to PyPi.org")
    And finally i updated the README :).
