## Documentation

### Day 1
I made simple projects to get me started.  
I learned how Python reads from the keyboard and how to make a function, then reuse it in another file.

### Day 2
I was a bit lazy and did not accomplish much.  
However, I learned how to package files and reuse them.

### Day 3
I started experimenting with JSON files.  
I made my first JSON writer and then began working on a schedule program for my mom.  
I read about best practices for this and considered using an API from [OpenHolidays](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/en/ "Go to Open Holidays API Page"), but I ended up using the [holidays-lib](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/ "Go to PyPi.org").  
Finally, I updated this README.

### Day 4 - Day 6
I had to take a break due to personal reasons but we are back on Day 7
